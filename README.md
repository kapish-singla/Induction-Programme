# Day 1(30-07-2025)

My first day at **Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College** began alongside other B.Tech students with a visit to the Gurudwara at 8:30 a.m. There, we attended the **Shabad Kirtan** and observed how the Gurudwara’s structure, resembling a ship, symbolized the guiding path ahead for us as students. The serene atmosphere set a positive tone for the day, and we were also served refreshing tea before moving to the next session.
Following the Gurudwara visit, we gathered in the auditorium, where we were introduced to the college’s infrastructure, achievements, and legacy. The occasion was marked by the celebration of **70 years of excellence** at the institution. We also had the opportunity to meet our respected teachers, Heads of Departments, and distinguished guests, who shared valuable insights about the college’s vision and opportunities. 

# Day 2 
# **Universal Human Values**
The day began with a session on Universal Human Values, conducted by Dr. Priya Darshni. Although she holds a PhD in Electronics, she has chosen to focus her career on this field, bringing a unique perspective to the subject. The session explored the ideas of happiness and contentment, highlighting how these states of mind influence our everyday actions and decisions. Her approach offered fresh insights into practical ways of achieving genuine happiness. The discussion was further enriched through real-life examples shared by both the speaker and participants, making the concepts easier to understand and apply.
