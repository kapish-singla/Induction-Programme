# Induction-Programme

# Day 1(30-07-2025)

My first day at **Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College** began alongside other B.Tech students with a visit to the Gurudwara at 8:30 a.m. There, we attended the **Shabad Kirtan** and observed how the Gurudwara’s structure, resembling a ship, symbolized the guiding path ahead for us as students. The serene atmosphere set a positive tone for the day, and we were also served refreshing tea before moving to the next session.
Following the Gurudwara visit, we gathered in the auditorium, where we were introduced to the college’s infrastructure, achievements, and legacy. The occasion was marked by the celebration of **70 years of excellence** at the institution. We also had the opportunity to meet our respected teachers, Heads of Departments, and distinguished guests, who shared valuable insights about the college’s vision and opportunities. 

# Day 2 
# **Universal Human Values**
The day began with a session on Universal Human Values, conducted by Dr. Priya Darshni. Although she holds a PhD in Electronics, she has chosen to focus her career on this field, bringing a unique perspective to the subject. The session explored the ideas of happiness and contentment, highlighting how these states of mind influence our everyday actions and decisions. Her approach offered fresh insights into practical ways of achieving genuine happiness. The discussion was further enriched through real-life examples shared by both the speaker and participants, making the concepts easier to understand and apply.

# Satyam Scolarship
Following the Human Values session, we were introduced to the Satyam Scholarship initiative. The speakers highlighted Buddy4Study, a leading private scholarship platform that collaborates with numerous companies, institutions, and foundations across India. We learned about its reach among students nationwide, its merit- and need-based awards, and the simple registration process, which was demonstrated live during the session.
# Personality Development
The next session was conducted by Dr. Arvind Dhingra, who spoke on personality development and the importance of building a positive presence in college. He emphasized making new friends, engaging with peers, and maintaining a neat, presentable appearance. To make the session interactive, he involved students in team-based games.

# Games
In the first game, 11 boys and 11 girls formed separate groups, each linking their arms in a crisscross pattern—boys holding only boys’ hands, and girls holding only girls’ hands. The challenge was to untangle themselves back into a straight line without breaking the chain. The boys’ team completed the task first and won chocolates.

The second game brought everyone into a large circle, holding hands while facing the center. The twist was that they had to turn and face outward without letting go of each other’s hands—a task that proved too tricky, as no group succeeded this time.



# Reflection

The sessions together offered a balanced mix of mindset, opportunity, and personal growth. The Human Values lesson reminded us that success is rooted in self-awareness, integrity, and meaningful relationships. The Satyam Scholarship talk showed how external support can help turn those aspirations into reality when combined with merit and need. Dr. Arvind Dhingra’s engaging personality development activities added a practical dimension—teaching us how to connect with people, present ourselves confidently, and work effectively in teams. Together, these experiences reinforced that growth in college is not just academic, but also about seizing opportunities, building relationships, and developing a personality that reflects our values.

# Day 3 
# **Causmic Club**
We were also introduced to the Caustic Club, the student body responsible for managing various events and activities on campus. They explained how their work is organized into different teams, such as a database and IT group, a social media group, and other specialized roles. The club plays a key role in hosting induction programmes, managing events in the auditorium, and ensuring smooth coordination among teams. They spoke about how they can also assist students in general matters—like offering study guidance, recommending coding languages, or advising on laptop purchases. They showcased their social media presence and played a few videos highlighting past events. The members also shared how they handle sponsorships and raise funds for activities. They also showed full process of signing github . In the end, they took one or two queries from the audience and reiterated that they are always available for help whenever needed.

# Motorsports

Later, Mr. Gautam Muria began his auditorium session with an engaging video on motorsports, instantly capturing everyone’s attention. He followed it with a short discussion on what motorsports truly involve, asking a couple of quick questions to the audience about cars and racing to spark interaction. He highlighted how motorsports is not just a thrilling sport but also a field deeply connected to engineering—requiring precision, innovation, and problem-solving skills. The talk emphasized how engineering students can draw inspiration from the teamwork, technology, and dedication seen in motorsports, applying those same principles in their own academic and professional journeys.

# Universal Human Values

The session ended with Ms. Priya Darshani addressing Universal Human Values and the importance of mental well-being. She spoke about dealing with depression, staying self-aware, and building supportive relationships, leaving the audience with a thoughtful reminder to value both their own and others’ mental health.

# Day 4
# Millet Super Food
Today’s schedule had fewer induction events, but a notable session on Millet – The Superfood was delivered by Mrs. Shaffy Makkar, Vice Principal at JHSKMS Ludhiana, university topper, with 24 years of teaching and research experience, and a representative of Punjab at the National Science Exhibition. She began by asking students if they liked millet, using this to open a discussion on its role as a highly nutritious superfood. The talk covered the various types of millets, their health benefits such as improved digestion and sustained energy, and simple yet effective cooking techniques to incorporate them into daily diets.
# Day 5
# Dean of Student Welfare
The day at GNDEC proved to be both engaging and inspiring. It began with an address by **Dr. Parminder Singh**, Dean of Student Welfare, who introduced us to the diverse student-led initiatives on campus and explained how the Student Welfare Committee actively supports learners in both academic and personal growth.

# Fitness
Next, **Mr. Manpreet Singh**, a professional fitness coach, delivered an energetic session on the importance of maintaining both physical and mental fitness, especially for engineering students who often face long hours of study. He shared practical exercise routines aimed at building strength, enhancing stamina, and promoting overall well-being—some of which I’m eager to try out.

The day concluded with an impactful talk by **Brigadier P.S. Cheema**, who spoke passionately about discipline, commitment, and staying true to one’s life goals. Drawing from his own experiences, he offered valuable insights that left a lasting impression.
 # Day 6
 # CML
The day began with our regular class sessions in the morning, keeping the usual academic pace. Later, we gathered in the auditorium for a series of interactive and thought-provoking sessions. The first was led by Dr. Lakhvir Singh Khana, in-charge of CML, which turned out to be more of a lively student–teacher interaction than a formal lecture. The hall was buzzing with energy and curiosity.
# Shabad
Following this, the college arranged a shabad to offer our respects and connect spiritually. The serene atmosphere during the recitation brought a sense of calm and reflection to everyone present.

# NSS
Next, Dr. Jasvir Singh Grewal, in-charge of NSS, took the stage. He explained that the National Service Scheme goes far beyond tree-planting, touching many aspects of social responsibility. A video he presented—showing an island where birds were dying due to plastic ingestion—left a lasting impact. Seeing plastic bottle caps and other waste inside the birds was both shocking and saddening, sparking serious concern about environmental care.

The day wrapped up with engaging activities organized by NSS members, bringing a sense of teamwork and lightheartedness after the more serious discussions.
