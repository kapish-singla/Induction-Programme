# Day 1(30-07-2025)

My first day at **Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College** began alongside other B.Tech students with a visit to the Gurudwara at 8:30 a.m. There, we attended the **Shabad Kirtan** and observed how the Gurudwara’s structure, resembling a ship, symbolized the guiding path ahead for us as students. The serene atmosphere set a positive tone for the day, and we were also served refreshing tea before moving to the next session.
Following the Gurudwara visit, we gathered in the auditorium, where we were introduced to the college’s infrastructure, achievements, and legacy. The occasion was marked by the celebration of **70 years of excellence** at the institution. We also had the opportunity to meet our respected teachers, Heads of Departments, and distinguished guests, who shared valuable insights about the college’s vision and opportunities. 

# Day 2 
# **Universal Human Values**
The day began with a session on Universal Human Values, conducted by Dr. Priya Darshni. Although she holds a PhD in Electronics, she has chosen to focus her career on this field, bringing a unique perspective to the subject. The session explored the ideas of happiness and contentment, highlighting how these states of mind influence our everyday actions and decisions. Her approach offered fresh insights into practical ways of achieving genuine happiness. The discussion was further enriched through real-life examples shared by both the speaker and participants, making the concepts easier to understand and apply.

# Satyam Scolarship
Following the Human Values session, we were introduced to the Satyam Scholarship program. The representatives spoke about Buddy4Study, a major private scholarship platform that collaborates with numerous companies, institutions, and foundations across India. They shared its wide reach among students nationwide and explained how it offers opportunities based on both merit and financial need. The session also included guidance on the registration process and eligibility, with a live demonstration of a student successfully signing up.

# Reflection

The day’s sessions highlighted how values and opportunities go hand in hand. The Human Values lesson reminded us that true happiness stems from self-awareness, meaningful relationships, and contributing positively to society. The Satyam Scholarship discussion complemented this by showing how resources and support can empower deserving students to pursue their aspirations. Together, they underscored that personal growth is not only about internal virtues but also about making the most of the opportunities that align with those values.
