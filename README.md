# Induction-Programme

# Day 1(30-07-2025)

My first day at **Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College** began alongside other B.Tech students with a visit to the Gurudwara at 8:30 a.m. There, we attended the **Shabad Kirtan** and observed how the Gurudwara’s structure, resembling a ship, symbolized the guiding path ahead for us as students. The serene atmosphere set a positive tone for the day, and we were also served refreshing tea before moving to the next session.
Following the Gurudwara visit, we gathered in the auditorium, where we were introduced to the college’s infrastructure, achievements, and legacy. The occasion was marked by the celebration of **70 years of excellence** at the institution. We also had the opportunity to meet our respected teachers, Heads of Departments, and distinguished guests, who shared valuable insights about the college’s vision and opportunities. 

# Day 2 
# **Universal Human Values**
The day began with a session on Universal Human Values, conducted by Dr. Priya Darshni. Although she holds a PhD in Electronics, she has chosen to focus her career on this field, bringing a unique perspective to the subject. The session explored the ideas of happiness and contentment, highlighting how these states of mind influence our everyday actions and decisions. Her approach offered fresh insights into practical ways of achieving genuine happiness. The discussion was further enriched through real-life examples shared by both the speaker and participants, making the concepts easier to understand and apply.

# Satyam Scolarship
Following the Human Values session, we were introduced to the Satyam Scholarship initiative. The speakers highlighted Buddy4Study, a leading private scholarship platform that collaborates with numerous companies, institutions, and foundations across India. We learned about its reach among students nationwide, its merit- and need-based awards, and the simple registration process, which was demonstrated live during the session.
# Personality Development
The next session was conducted by Dr. Arvind Dhingra, who spoke on personality development and the importance of building a positive presence in college. He emphasized making new friends, engaging with peers, and maintaining a neat, presentable appearance. To make the session interactive, he involved students in team-based games.

# Games
In the first game, 11 boys and 11 girls formed separate groups, each linking their arms in a crisscross pattern—boys holding only boys’ hands, and girls holding only girls’ hands. The challenge was to untangle themselves back into a straight line without breaking the chain. The boys’ team completed the task first and won chocolates.

The second game brought everyone into a large circle, holding hands while facing the center. The twist was that they had to turn and face outward without letting go of each other’s hands—a task that proved too tricky, as no group succeeded this time.



# Reflection

The sessions together offered a balanced mix of mindset, opportunity, and personal growth. The Human Values lesson reminded us that success is rooted in self-awareness, integrity, and meaningful relationships. The Satyam Scholarship talk showed how external support can help turn those aspirations into reality when combined with merit and need. Dr. Arvind Dhingra’s engaging personality development activities added a practical dimension—teaching us how to connect with people, present ourselves confidently, and work effectively in teams. Together, these experiences reinforced that growth in college is not just academic, but also about seizing opportunities, building relationships, and developing a personality that reflects our values.

# Day 3 
# **Causmic Club**
We were also introduced to the Caustic Club, the student body responsible for managing various events and activities on campus. They explained how their work is organized into different teams, such as a database and IT group, a social media group, and other specialized roles. The club plays a key role in hosting induction programmes, managing events in the auditorium, and ensuring smooth coordination among teams. They spoke about how they can also assist students in general matters—like offering study guidance, recommending coding languages, or advising on laptop purchases. They showcased their social media presence and played a few videos highlighting past events. The members also shared how they handle sponsorships and raise funds for activities. They also showed full process of signing github . In the end, they took one or two queries from the audience and reiterated that they are always available for help whenever needed.

# Motorsports

Later, Mr. Gautam Muria began his auditorium session with an engaging video on motorsports, instantly capturing everyone’s attention. He followed it with a short discussion on what motorsports truly involve, asking a couple of quick questions to the audience about cars and racing to spark interaction. He highlighted how motorsports is not just a thrilling sport but also a field deeply connected to engineering—requiring precision, innovation, and problem-solving skills. The talk emphasized how engineering students can draw inspiration from the teamwork, technology, and dedication seen in motorsports, applying those same principles in their own academic and professional journeys.
